  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :            -37.208303091 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :            -37.209801061 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV
  | For reference only, the overall average (free atom contribution

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.

  and postdocs), scientific credit in the community is essential.
  Thank you for helping us!

  Of course, there are many other important community references, e.g., those cited in the
  above references. Our list is limited to references that describe implementations in the
  FHI-aims code. The reason is purely practical (length of this list) - please credit others as well.

          | Peak values for overall tracked memory usage:

          |   Maximum:        9.435 MB (on task 0 after allocating min_atom_atom_tab)
          |   Average:        9.435 MB
          | Largest tracked array allocation:
          |   Minimum:        6.223 MB (atom_atom_dist_list on task 0)
          |   Maximum:        6.223 MB (atom_atom_dist_list on task 0)
          |   Average:        6.223 MB
          Note:  These values currently only include a subset of arrays which are explicitly tracked.
          The "true" memory usage will be greater.

          Have a nice day.
